In Asian\nsupermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted\ncharcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,\nwrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the\nsalted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a\nfirm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/2b40c/salty_egg.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAPABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMB/8QAFwEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEEBf/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABgik0dXC//8QAGRABAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACEhEy/9oACAEBAAEFAkqW2DlnRj73yf/EABcRAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREkH/2gAIAQMBAT8B1WX/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQL/2gAIAQIBAT8Bi6f/xAAbEAABBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIRISIxMv/aAAgBAQAGPwK9GNocyS8hCj//xAAbEAADAQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABESEAMUGBof/aAAgBAQABPyGxNMfrLHmCDZmAzzvJJDjEQCHv/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABDIL//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERAP/aAAgBAwEBPxARhylZv//EABgRAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABESFR/9oACAECAQE/EFoktI//xAAdEAEBAAICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAABEQAxIWFBcYHh/9oACAEBAAE/EEbMLQ0fMHDVaPIXyI4pk4JUnWacNCtO8ojDE9TGIYES7/Jn/9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Chinese Salty Egg\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/c739e/salty_egg.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/8ee9c/salty_egg.jpg 148w,\n/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/ebbe7/salty_egg.jpg 295w,\n/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/c739e/salty_egg.jpg 590w,\n/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/5413e/salty_egg.jpg 885w,\n/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/4efde/salty_egg.jpg 1180w,\n/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/2b40c/salty_egg.jpg 2048w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 01, 2015","title":"Hello World","description":null,"author":null}}}]}}}
