It feels a bit like you are given a blank canvas. No rules. No limitations.

The guardians of wildcards pay a self assessed fee to the conservation in order to hold the title of guardian.

I.e. a vote of size 9 will have a power of 3, a vote of size 100 will only have a power 10 etc. The desired result is that users with large amounts of voting power cannot radically swing the result toward one specific candidate. \nThe idea of Quadratic voting is explored extensively in the book, Radical Economics, and therefore named after one author Glen Weyl.</p>\n<p>Who gets to vote?\nAnyone who is the guardian of a wildcard, is rewarded with 1 wildcard loyalty token per day. The guardian can then use these loyalty tokens to vote for the conservation that they believe should receive the funds raised from Glen the Dragon. The vote will happen on a monthly basis.</p>\n<p>That’s it! We are super stoked that we managed to nab 3rd place at the ETHTurin hackathon. Thanks to Denham Preen, Jason Smythe and Andrew Stanger for being such cool teammates. \nIt’s time to grab a wildcard and start voting on where you want to see the money go!</p>\n<p>Follow our socials to learn more about our project and the conservation causes we are working towards.</p>\n<p>Follow us on twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wildcards_world\">@wildcards_world</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wildcardscrypto\">@wildcardscrypto</a></p>\n<p>Join us on Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/wildcardsworld\">Telegram</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Community governance through quadratic voting at Italy's first Ethereum hackathon [Remote edition]","date":"May 04, 2020","description":"We are launching a new wildcard (Glen the Dragon) in the next 48 hours!
